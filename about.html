			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Katie. I'm starting my weight loss journey at 164 pounds. At 5'2" I only need to lose one more pound to escape obesity, but much more to not be overweight. Not many full body pictures of me exist at this weight.<br>

		<br> ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contrast, this is how I looked at about 140 pounds. Not skinny, but not nearly as big as I am now.</div>
