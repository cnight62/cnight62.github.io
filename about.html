				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Katie. I created this website back in 2018 starting at around 167 pounds. I was overweight even then, but now, in 2024, my starting weight has climbed to a hefty 213 pounds, which is well into the obese range for someone who is only 5'2". At 37, the extra weight is making me look even older than I already am, not to mention highly uncomfortable. I have elevated blood sugar as well, which has not yet progressed to full-blown diabetes. I also have a diagnosed underactive thyroid, which has only gotten worse over the years.

				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contrast, this is how I looked at about 130 to 140 pounds, in my late twenties or early thirties. Probably a healthy weight for my height.
			</span>
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say I've tried it all. I haven't tried Keto, I haven't tried Atkin's, I haven't tried Weight Watchers, or Noom. Every plan I've embarked on has been of my own devising, except perhaps the time I gave the Military Diet a try. Since my morning coffee with cream comes close to 300 calories, my latest attempt will involve three 300 calorie eating sessions a day, along with a walking and light weight lifting routine. 		       
		       <br>
		       <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping this website, especially my "before" pictures, and the daily accountability I expect to establish by writing about my progress each day, will help me be more successful. For reference I am starting at a size 18 pants size (and even those are getting tight, yikes!), or XXL in pants and XL or sometimes XXL in shirts.
			<br>
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I bought three books that claimed to contain 300 calorie recipes. Unfortunately the authors of two of them seem to have subscribed to the old-fashioned low-fat craze - nearly every recipe contains "low-fat" this or "reduced-fat" that. I personally don't agree with this approach, since in many cases added sugars or other processed ingredients are added after the fat is removed, and I prefer to eat foods in their natural form. There is still hot debate on the internet about the merits of whole vs. reduced fat dairy, but I'll take my full fat half and half with my coffee, thank you.
			<br>
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I am fat is not because I eat full-fat food products, but because I just eat too much in general. Though not officially diagnosed, I fit all the criteria for binge eating disorder, and even on the days I'm not binging, I consistently consume at least a few hundred more than 2000 calories a day. I'm hoping to change that as of 6/1/2024.
