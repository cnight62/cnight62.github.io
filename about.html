				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Katie. I'm starting my weight loss journey at 164 pounds. At 5'2" I only need to lose one more pound to escape obesity, but 20 more to not be overweight. Putting on the extra weight has affected my self esteem and my energy levels. To put it in the simplest way, "I feel fat." I'm well aware I'm not extraordinarily fat, and actually blend into generally overweight populace of this country. However, the "before" pictures I display before week 1 make me want to stop eating for about a month.

				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contrast, this is how I looked at about 130 to 140 pounds. Probably a healthy weight for my height, though I still wasn't happy with how I looked in a bathing suit. (What woman is?)
			</span>
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These meal plans are guidelines of the MOST I can eat in a day. I will try to generally adhere to these meals but may try to eat smaller portions of each meal than listed in order to accelerate my weight loss. Before this attempt I began my weight loss efforts at 180 pounds and got to 169 through alternate periods of fasting, or starving myself, however you want to look at it. Then I plateaued at 169 for several months, finally losing another two pounds and reaching 167 pounds.		       
			<br>
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created a 21 day meal plan with an expected weight loss of 3 pounds and lost, surprise, 3 pounds! However I lost most of the weight in the last week as I started to eat less than the listed portions. Even in week 2 I was still 167 pounds because I kept overeating in the evenings. If I had followed the 21 day meal plan exactly I expect I would have lost 7 pounds. I am including the plan on this website for anyone interested. The grocery bill was about 200 a week and I had to adapt. Also I was not consistent with including my daily weight and notes, since I became discouraged by how often I cheated on my diet in the first 21 days.
		       <br>
		       <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping this website, especially my "before" pictures, and the daily accountability I expect to establish by writing about my progress each day, will help me be more successful than I was in my initial 21 days.
