				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Katie. I created this website back in 2018, originally targeting a 1200 calorie per day diet. As I have been unable to stick to this restriction, or be particulare successful at any approach, I am renewing my use of the site but increasing the calories to 1500.
