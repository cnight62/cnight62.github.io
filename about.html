			Hi, my name is Katie. I'm starting my weight loss journey at 164 pounds. At 5'2" I only need to lose one more pound to escape obesity, but 20 more to not be overweight.</span>
<br>
		<span>
			<img style="float:right" src="https://cnight62.github.io/thinMe.jpg"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contrast, this is how I looked at about 140 pounds. Not skinny, but not nearly as big as I am now.</span>
		<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These meal plans are guidelines of the MOST I can eat in a day. I will try to generally adhere to these meals but may try to eat smaller portions of each meal than listed in order to accelerate my weight loss. Before this attempt I began my weight loss efforts at 180 pounds and got to 169 through alternate periods of fasting. Then I plateaued at 169 for several months, finally losing another two pounds and reaching 167 pounds.
			<br> 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created a 21 day meal plan with an expected weight loss of 3 pounds and lost, surprise, 3 pounds! However I lost most of the weight in the last week as I started to eat less than the listed portions. Even in week 2 I was still 167 pounds because I kept overeating at night. If I had followed the 21 day meal plan to a T I expect I would have lost 7 pounds. I am including the plan on this website for anyone interested. The grocery bill was about 200 a week and I had to adapt. Also I was not consistent with including my daily weight and notes, since I became discouraged by how often I cheated on my diet in the first 21 days.
