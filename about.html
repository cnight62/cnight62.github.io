				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Katie. I created this website back in 2018 starting at around 167 pounds. Now, in 2023, my starting weight has climbed to a hefty 204.8 pounds, which is well into the obese range for someone who is only 5'2". At 37, the extra weight is making me look even older than I already am, not to mention highly uncomfortable. I have elevated blood sugar as well, which I take medication for.

				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contrast, this is how I looked at about 130 to 140 pounds, in my late twenties or early thirties. Probably a healthy weight for my height.
			</span>
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say I've tried it all. I haven't tried Keto, I haven't tried Atkin's, I haven't tried Weight Watchers. Every plan I've embarked on has been of my own devising. My latest attempt is based on a documentary I watched on Amazon Prime called "Beyond Weight Loss" which recommends five mini-meals of 300 calories a day. I just went to the grocery store and stocked up for a week of clean eating. Yes, it will be boring to eat the same menu every day for a week, but if I added more variety it would just up the grocery bill. You should see all the squash and zucchini in my refrigerator right now!		       
			<br>
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipes section is based on a diet plan I created five years ago to consume 1200 calories a day. Now I will have to seek out new recipes - and it is extraordinarily difficult to find delicious recipes that produce a meal that is guaranteed to be under 300 calories!
		       <br>
		       <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping this website, especially my "before" pictures, and the daily accountability I expect to establish by writing about my progress each day, will help me be more successful than I have been the last five years. For reference I am starting at a size 18 pants size (yikes!).
