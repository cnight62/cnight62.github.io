				 <tr><td></td>Hi, my name is Katie and I weigh 166 pounds. At a height of 5' 2" that puts me just a few pounds into an obese BMI. I am looking to lose 67 pounds by following a 1200 calorie diet. In order to do so I am preparing weekly 1200 calorie a day meal plans.</td>
				 </tr>
				 <tr><td>At first I attempted to create a 21 day meal plan but the grocery bill was absurdly large and there were a ton of leftovers after each week. Thus my weekly meal plans only include six days, with the seventh day being a "leftovers day" where I create a 1200 calorie plan out of what is already in the fridge.</td></tr></table></center></td>
