				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Katie. I created this website back in 2018, originally targeting a 1200 calorie per day diet. As I have been unable to stick to this restriction, or be particulare successful at any approach, I am renewing my use of the site but increasing the calories to 1600.
			</span>
			<span>
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually if I can follow my meal plans and hit a plateau weight I will try reducing to 1500 calories and so on; in all my goal is to drop 80 pounds.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I have been struggling with my weight for years, trying and abandoning many plans, my off and on efforts have allowed me to at least keep my weight from climbing much in the past two years.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in late 2024 I embark yet again, with an attitude of needing to make continual effort to avoid drowning entirely, even if I am only treading water at times and am discouraged by my previous lack of success. What else can I do? Give up altogether and let the weight gain continue further? I'll never give up trying.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My meal plan approach, where every intake of food for a day must follow a pre-established list, should, especially at 1600 calories, keep me from being outright hungry.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However it totally forbids restaurant or delivery dining. This may prove difficult due to both social eating situations and my own difficulties with self-control surrounding food.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note, I am not a medical professional but I attempted to adhere to general guidelines about nutrition, such as including at least two servings of vegetables and one of fruit per day, along with ample protein and some whole grain carbohydrates.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end I plan to consult a dietitian on my meal plans, to see if there are any recommendations or criticisms. If there are any, I plan to post them for each week and update as needed; no doubt it includes far too much saturated fat from the half and half in my morning coffee, and it may be more effective to use a lighter source of coffee cream. I also plan to post notes on my progress daily.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish me luck! I'll definitely need it. If anyone were to find this obscure github site in the universe of the internet and wanted to try my approach, please consult a doctor before embarking, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions. For myself I have no allergies and have never been advised to avoid certain foods.
