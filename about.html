				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Katie. I created this website back in 2018, originally targeting a 1200 calorie per day diet. As I have been unable to stick to this restriction, I am renewing my use of the site but increasing the calories to 1600.
			</span>
			<br>
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say I've tried it all. I haven't tried Keto, I haven't tried Atkin's, I haven't tried Weight Watchers, or Noom. Every plan I've embarked on has been of my own devising, except perhaps the time I gave the Military Diet a try.
		       <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping this website,and the daily accountability I expect to establish by writing about my progress each day, will help me be more successful than I have been. I also plan to go from a sedentary lifestyle to light walking and low-resistance weight training.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I bought three books that claimed to contain 300 calorie recipes. Unfortunately the authors of two of them seem to have subscribed to the old-fashioned low-fat craze - nearly every recipe contains "low-fat" this or "reduced-fat" that. I personally don't agree with this approach, since in many cases added sugars or other processed ingredients are added after the fat is removed, and I prefer to eat foods in their natural form. There is still hot debate on the internet about the merits of whole vs. reduced fat dairy, but I'll take my full fat half and half with my coffee, personally.
