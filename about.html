				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, my name is Katie. I created this website back in 2018 starting at around 167 pounds. I was overweight even then, but now, in 2024, my starting weight has climbed to a hefty 213 pounds, which is well into the obese range for someone who is only 5'2". At 37, the extra weight is making me look even older than I already am, not to mention highly uncomfortable. I have elevated blood sugar as well, which has not yet progressed to full-blown diabetes. I also have a diagnosed underactive thyroid, which has only gotten worse over the years.

				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For contrast, this is how I looked at about 130 to 140 pounds, in my late twenties or early thirties. Probably a healthy weight for my height.
			</span>
			<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say I've tried it all. I haven't tried Keto, I haven't tried Atkin's, I haven't tried Weight Watchers, or Noom. Every plan I've embarked on has been of my own devising, except perhaps the time I gave the Military Diet a try. Since my morning coffee with cream comes close to 300 calories, my latest attempt will involve three 300 calorie eating sessions a day.

		       <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hoping this website, especially my "before" pictures, and the daily accountability I expect to establish by writing about my progress each day, will help me be more successful. For reference I am starting at a size 18 pants size (and even those are getting tight, yikes!), or XXL in pants and XL or sometimes XXL in shirts.
