	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, although I ate more than the listed amounts at least 70% of the time, I managed to lose three pounds and discovered a few great recipes. I like the creamy pesto chicken salad so much I will be using it in my first 6 day meal plan. The poke was also a great recipe which I am going to adapt into an even lower calorie 'Katie's Poke' using zucchini noodles instead of rice. I have ordered a veggie spiralizer and a food scale which should be delivered within a few days.
	    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one of my downfalls was using too large servings of proteins, mainly chicken, so the food scale should help with that. The stuffed chicken was a dish that my fiance enjoyed as much as I did -I would only recommend using a higher stuffing to chicken recipe next time. The dessert recipes did not work out at all -the day I made the peanut butter banana cups they were so delicious that I ended up eating all of them that day. I think I am going to stick to the 100 calorie ice cream bars from here on out. Making large servings of dessert items is too tempting.
	    <br><br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this 21 day meal plan was just too expensive to maintain. I picked some elaborate recipes with a lot of specialty ingredients and the average bill was $200 a week. A fair amount of food went to waste as well. My first week's meal plan will include two very simple protein/vegetable dinners (salmon with asparagus and pork with green beans) and also two days I will have a lunch that consists merely of two pieces of bread with turkey and some mustard. I am hoping to at least maintain 164 pounds, if not lose another pound while I live on the numerous leftovers from the last week. I still have a fair amount of kale and spinach and some chicken as well, leftover Thai Basil Beef bowl and Chicken Pot Pie pockets, and a few vegetables remaining.
	    <br><br>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My strategy for week 1 of 6 day meal planning will be to regard my menu as the maximum I can eat, not the amount I must eat. So if I can manage to eat less than the listed amounts (especially if I can just cut out the oatmeal in the evening) I hope to accelerate my weight loss. Eating less than 1200 calories is not recommended but it just seems like a lot of food for someone trying to lose weight. I guarantee I won't be eating below 1000 on any given day, but it is a good strategy for me to eat a much smaller amount of calories when I can manage to to make up for the days that I eat over the plan. Now that I have created this website I am hoping that knowing I have my daily "public post" to the few people who will see this website will help create some accountability. I also have my somewhat embarassing, though not mortifying, "before" swimsuit photos to motivate me to stay on track. I am hoping to include full body pictures weekly and ultimately gather them on to one "weight loss gallery" page to show off my progress. I only wish I had a full body shot of myself where I truly started, 180 pounds, so I could feel some pride in my progress so far. I really don't feel like I look any thinner than I did before I lost 15 pounds, but I don't have a photographic basis for comparison.
