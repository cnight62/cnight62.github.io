<p id ="g">G. Kung Pao Chicken Zoodles for Two (277 calories)</p>

Ingredients:
16 oz zucchini noodles
1 tsp oil
6 oz chicken breasts, cut into ½ inch pieces
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper; to taste
½ red bell pepper; cut into ½ inch pieces
1 tsp sesame oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp fresh ground ginger
2 Tbsp crushed dry roasted peanuts
2 Tbsp thinly sliced scallions along diagonal
 
For the sauce:

1 ½ Tbsp reduced soy sauce
1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tsp hoisin sauce
2 ½ Tbsp water
1/2 tsp Sambal Oelek Red Chili Paste
2 tsp sugar
2 tsp cornstarch

Recipe calls for making your own zucchini noodles but I am buying them premade.

In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, balsamic, hoisin, water, red chili paste, sugar and cornstarch; set aside.

Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Heat oil in a large, deep nonstick pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside.

Reduce heat to medium, add sesame oil, garlic and ginger to the skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the bell pepper, stir in the soy sauce mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until thickened and bubbling, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in zucchini noodles and cook, mixing for about 2 minutes until just tender and mixed with the sauce. If it seems dry, don’t worry the zucchini will release moisture which helps create a sauce. Once cooked, mix in chicken and divide between 2 bowls (about 2 cups each) and top with peanuts and scallions.

<p id ="m">M. Stuffed Chicken & Sauteed Kale with Pine Nuts (369 calories for ¼)</p>

Ingredients:

2 Tbsp jarred pesto
1 Tbsp 2% Greek yogurt
¼ cup shredded Mozzarella
1 Tbsp grated parmesan
1 clove garlic, minced
¼ cup sliced Sun-dried tomatoes
4 chicken breasts (approx. 5 ounces each, uncooked), pounded to ¼” thick
¼ cup bread crumbs
2 large eggs
1 bunch chopped kale, stems removed (about 4 cups)
½ Tbsp butter
¼ cup diced onion
¼ cup pine nuts


Preheat oven to 375.

Mix together the pesto, yogurt, cheese, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes. Spread a thin layer on each chicken breast and roll it up, sealing with toothpicks.

Set up two shallow bowls, one with whisked eggs, the other with bread crumbs. Dip chicken rolls in the eggs, followed by the bread crumbs, making sure to evenly coat each one. This can be a bit tricky at first, so try to weave the toothpick to “sew” up the chicken so none of the stuffing escapes.

Heat a large, lightly greased skillet on medium-high and brown the chicken rolls on each side. Transfer chicken rolls to a lightly greased baking dish and bake until fully cooked, about 30 minutes.

While the chicken bakes, prepare the kale, onions and pine nuts. Wash, pat dry and separate stems. Heat butter in a large skillet and sautee onions on medium heat until translucent, then add pine nuts and toss for about two minutes. Transfer to a plate and then add kale to skillet with approximately two tablespoons water. Heat until wilted, about 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Serve chicken over sautéed kale topped with onions and pine nuts.

<p id ="r">R. Chicken Pot Pockets (makes 12 servings of which I will eat 2)

Ingredients:
½ cup fat free cream of celery soup
10 oz frozen mixed vegetables, bite size
2 oz boneless, cooked chicken breast
1 oz cornstarch (1 tsp)
12 egg roll wrappers


Preheat oven to 350.

In a small dish, mix cornstarch thoroughly with 1 tsp cold water. In a large bowl, combine cornstarch mixture with soup, and mix thoroughly.

Add vegetables and chicken, mix well, and then season to taste with salt and pepper, if you like. This is your filling. Set aside.

On a large dry surface, lay out three egg roll wrappers. Set out a small dish of water, dip your finger into it, and then run your finger along all of the wrapper edges –repeat as needed while preparing your pockets, as it will help keep them sealed.

Starting about 1/2” from the bottom, place 2-3 Tbsp of filling along the bottom half of each wrapper, leaving a ½” border on both sides. Salt and pepper to taste.

Fold the top half of each wrapper over, so that the top edge meets the bottom –the mixture should be completely encased with a 1/2” border on three sides. Dab each border with water, and fold each inward about ¼” to lightly seal all sides. Press firmly along the borders with the prongs of a fork to seal completely.

Line a large baking pan with foil and/or spray with nonstick spray. Using a large spatula, carefully transfer the pocket to the baking pan. Repeat the entire process 3 more times, so that you have 12 pockets on the baking sheet. If needed, prepare and use an additional baking sheet.

Bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
