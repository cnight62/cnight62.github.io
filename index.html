		<div class="blockquote">Welcome to Twelve Hundred, where I share my 1200 calorie meal plans along with my own personal weight loss progress.  Click <a href="https://cnight62.github.io/about.html">ABOUT</a> to learn a little more about the creator of this website, or <a href="https://cnight62.github.io/weeks.html">WEEKS</a> to head straight to the mealplans!<br>Though I originally attempted to create a 21 day meal plan with 1200 calorie plans set for 7 days out of the week, I soon discovered the impracticability of this method, with a ton of leftover food waste and a very expensive grocery bill. I adapted the program to allow for 6 days of 1200 calorie meal plans with a 7th day where I must create the 1200 calorie meal plan that day based on what is leftover from groceries bought for the week. Others may choose to use this day a "cheat day" but I am attempting to have 0 cheat days/cheat meals in my diet until I lose at least 20 pounds.<br> I hope the story told by this website turns out to be an inspiring one, and that the recipes I have linked might help other overweight/obese individuals hoping to shed pounds. </div>
