		Exercise:

		Notes:
				I didn't have enough green beans to make 12 ounces so I supplemented with broccoli. Decided for next week I'm going to use unprocessed turkey and slice it for my sandwich instead of buying deli turkey, which is less healthy. But for this week, deli turkey!

				
<b>Day 4 (12/18/2024)</b>

                                3 cups of Coffee with half and half (~300 calories)

				20 minute walk, arm workout with 30 reps

		Notes:
				I'd like to include a sixth week in my rotation to include a few more exotic foods such as chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, and cooked artichokes, also I love avocado but I avoided it because it's hard to predict when they will be ripe. May work on that later.
				

<b>Day 5 (12/19/2024)</b>

				3 cups of Coffee with half and half (~300 calories)
				2 hard boiled Jumbo eggs with salt and pepper (180 calories)

				1 package cooked spinach (80 calories)
				1 cup carrot juice (100 calories)

		Exercise:
				20 minute walk, arm workout with 30 reps

		Notes:
				I realized I was counting the calories on my brown rice wrong after weighing myself and seeing I hadn't lost weight in two days, actually gained about .2 pounds. Need to adjust calories and serving size on rice. Could be I'm retaining water as I'm drinking loads of diet soda. Also I was kind of eyeballing my peanut butter but I'm going to measure it more strictly from now on.

                                12 oz green beans (105 calories) - substituted 110g carrots and 1/2 cup beets because I ran out of green beans
				7 oz shrimp with 1/4 cup cocktail sauce (370 calories)
				300g baked broccoli (100 calories)
				1 cup carrot juice (100 calories) - substituted 1 cup strawberries + 1/2 cup blueberries (~100 calories) because I already ate a lot of carrots
				1 cup canned pears in water (75 calories)

		Exercise:
				20 minute walk, arm workout with 30 reps

		Notes:
				I want to work beans and oranges into my plan...oranges should be easy but I'm not a big fan of legumes. Also I'd like to mix up my vegetable juice.
