		<h2>Week 1 - starting weight: 195lb - body fat: 48%</h2>
		
			<pre>
<b>Day 1 (Saturday 1/3/2026)</b>

				3 cups of Coffee with 3 Tbsp half and half each (180 calories)
				1 serving vegetable juice (60 calories)
				1/2 cup cereal with milk (250 calories)
				138g of Cauliflower Quinoa Bean Salad (290 calories)
				6 oz of baked salmon (300 calories)
				1/2 bunch asparagus (50 calories)
				1 piece of dark chocolate (20 calories)
				Spray/Saute fats used in cooking (50 calories)


		Exercise:
			45 minute walk
			Arm workout with eight pounds 3 sets of 30 for 4 moves
			3 sets of 20 situps

		Notes:	
			Intro gym session on Monday, so initial exercise plan will be adjusted based on pro recommendations.
			Will be doing approximately one hour gym sessions Mondays and Thursdays.
			Would also like to incorporate weekly rollerblading sessions.
			Plan to increase home lifting by one pound per month, so will be lifting 20 pounds by end of year.
			Also plan to do a pro nutritional consult for my plan once I set out a few weeks.
			Initial feelings: optimistic now with encouragement of a significant other, but was very frightened to see my intiial body fat percentage, which is dangerously high.
			First day result was near perfect - technically had a bit of grenadine in my diet soda at the bar and a spray of whipped cream with the chocolate, but I think I used less than 50 cal of cooking oil today.
				
<b>Day 2 (Sunday 1/4/2026)</b>

				3 cups of Coffee with 3 Tbsp half and half each (180 calories)
				1/2 cup cereal with milk (250 calories)

		Exercise:
			45 minute walk
			Arm workout with eight pounds 3 sets of 30 for 4 moves
			3 sets of 20 situps

		Notes:	
				I think I underestimated how many calories would end up in breading for the eggplant, will refine the calorie count when doing this dinner again.
				Otherwise, on track day.
				
<b>Day 3 (Monday 1/5/2026)</b>

				3 cups of Coffee with 3 Tbsp half and half each (180 calories)

		Exercise:
			45 minute walk

			3 sets of 20 situps

		Notes:
			Skipped my third set of the arm/ab workouts. Probably only walked 30 minutes.
			Plan to make up for it tomorrow.
			Also, I was dipping my fries in yogurt based ranch dressing as well as ketchup, so my dip probably had more calories in it than stated.
			I had a truffle from Christmas instead of a 20 calorie piece of chocolate, so I probably got over 80 extra calories through that.

		Notes:
			Based on weight loss service recommendations, starting today I am going from my original 1200 calorie plan to a 1300 a day plan.
			1300 is the minimum required by these weight loss professionals.
			Pretty successful day but only did two workout sets, thinking three is going too ambitious so lowering the bar to 2.
			Didn't actually weigh my chicken.

		Notes:
			Ran out of my quinoa salad AND my veg juice, so had 280 extra calories to play with.
			Basically on track but had to improvise for those calories.
			Have not had an alcoholic beverage since I began this week, as I am trying to remove alcohol from my consumption.
			Continued to not consume alcohol, even at a bar. Pretty compliant day I think, though a bit improvised with the food. Had two cookies I shouldn't have had but probably still within bounds of 13 or 1400 calories.
