		Exercise:
			45 minute walk, arm workout with eight pounds each arm 30 reps, 20 situps

		Notes:	
				I'm doing a high estimate for oils used in cooking to make sure spraying pan is not taking me over 1500 a day.
				I'm rounding up any estimates for foods that may vary in exact caloric content.
				Ended up switching dinners between today and tomorrow, followed all other plans to the letter except skipped walk and probably had too much remoulade.

		Notes:
			Still navigating the learning curve on precise meal planning while trying to avoid too much food waste.
			I try to design for a week at a time, but sometimes leftover portion sizes are unexpected and I have to adjust so that leftovers are eaten
			So today, dinner was leftover tofu noodles, and will have to push my gochuchang shrimp idea to another day.
			Good exercise adherence, meal plan mostly followed but had imprecise dinner serving since we tossed the noodles, tofu, sauce, and veg together.
