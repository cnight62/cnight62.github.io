		Exercise:
			45 minute walk, arm workout with eight pounds each arm 30 reps, 20 situps

		Notes:	
				I'm doing a high estimate for oils used in cooking to make sure spraying pan is not taking me over 1500 a day.
				I'm rounding up any estimates for foods that may vary in exact caloric content.
				Allotted extra alcohol portion for day 1 due to social plans that will definitely involve drinking.
				Ended up skipping the cauliflower salad and drinking over my budget. So maybe it balanced out. Good on exercise today.

			Good on exercise today, but had a pretty bad snack attack on just day 2, ate a big bowl of cereal, a low cal ice cream milkshake, a few chips, and some rice on top of my planned food. So that's pretty terrible.

		Notes:
				Skipped walk and situps and proceeded to drink 3 glasses of wine and eat a bunch of food not on my plan. I don't know how many times I have failed too many times in the first week and simply deleted my notes and just started over, but no more. The record of my failures will persist.

		Exercise:
			45 minute walk, arm workout with eight pounds each arm 30 reps, 20 situps

		Notes:
			Skipped situps, ordered fast food for lunch and made a small milkshake, exchanged dinner for cauliflower crust pizza which was probably less calories than the original dinner, but also had 1.5 alcoholic beverages. I need to just quit alcohol I think; I have nightly hand problems which may be carpel tunnel and alcohol just makes that worse. I already quit smoking in the past month so I think alcohol needs to be the next thing to go. Also ate a bunch of kettle corn and some leftover noodles.
