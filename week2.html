		<h2>Week 2 - starting weight: 211.2lb</h2>
		
			<pre>
<b>Day 1 (6/8/2024)</b>

                Breakfast (7AM):
                                3 cups of Coffee with half and half (~300 calories)
				2 hard boiled Jumbo eggs with salt and pepper (180 calories)
				
                Lunch (12PM):
                                Small portion of leftover sushi (~300 calories)
				
		Dinner (4PM):
				4 oz of baked salmon (175 calories)
				15 spears baked asparagus (60 calories)

		Exercise:
				None.

		Notes:
				I had leftover sushi from Friday night's binge so looking at it I eyeballed it at less than 300 cal.
				I also skipped my morning banana so I'm sure in total it worked out.
				For dinner I didn't weigh my salmon and had more than 15 spears (but they were thin).
				Other than that I stuck to plan.
				

<b>Day 2 (6/9/2024)</b>

		Breakfast (7AM):
                                2 cups of Coffee with half and half (~200 calories)
				1/2 cup oatmeal with 15 blueberries and 2 Tbsp maple syrup (245 calories)
				
                Lunch (12PM):
				2 oz of chicken, 2 oz of sweet potato on a 60 cal wrap with ranch (~300 calories)
				
		Dinner (4PM):
				Chicken and sweet potato on a 110 cal wrap with ranch (~400 calories)

		Exercise:
				None.

		Notes:
				After dinner I proceeded to eat cashews, a bowl of cereal, and
				made a mug cake. So I wouldn't qualify it as a full on binge but it was off plan and I felt
				disappointed with myself.

		Breakfast (7AM):
                                3 cups of Coffee with half and half (~300 calories)

		Notes:

				and ate one of the resulting muffins. Still, not a perfect day.

				6oz shrimp with spinach on a 60 cal wrap with Green Goddess dressing (~300 calories)

		Notes:
				Had my "first coffee" of this day technically on 6/12 since I woke up after having a four hour nap, so
				will only have two cups after I wake up again. Decided to wait until thirty perfect days
				have elapsed in a row before I add exercise. Unlikely anytime soon due to upcoming social events.
				Hurrah, I hate exercise!

		Exercise:
				None.
