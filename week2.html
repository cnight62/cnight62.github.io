		<h2>Week 2 - starting weight: 190.8</h2>
		
			<pre>
<b>Day 1 (11/27/2023)</b>

                Breakfast Part 1 (7AM):
                                3 cups of Coffee each with 3 Tbsp 1/2 and 1/2 (180 calories)
				1 hard boiled Jumbo egg with salt and pepper (90 calories)

		Breakfast Part 2 (10AM):
				1 grapefruit cup (60 calories)
				1 ounce mixed nuts (170 calories)
				
                Lunch Part 1 (12PM):
                                4 oz of sauteed chicken breast with seasoning (187 calories)
                                2 cups of raw spinach (28 calories)
				3 carrots (75 calories)
				
		Lunch Part 2 (3PM):
				2 oz of baked salmon (118 calories)
				50 grams of brown rice (170 calories)
				
                Dinner (5PM):
				1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash tossed in 1 Tbsp olive oil and baked (165 calories)
                                1 banana (105 calories)

		Notes:
				The initial weigh in for this week is slightly heavier because it was done on 10PM of week 2. Had sleepus
				interruptus and wanted my first cup of coffee. However, overall I didn't lose weight because I actually
				only stuck to my plan one out of seven days. Hoping to do better this week.
				End of day update - I got a massive sweets craving and ended up eating two cupcakes and a peanut butter cookie.
				I decided that instead of fruit at the end of the day I'm going to have half a cookie a day when the sweets
				craving hits to try to ward off overindulging on sugary foods in the evening. So at most if I am perfect
				I will have a 6/7 perfect day rate for this week.
				

<b>Day 2 (11/28/2023)</b>

		 Breakfast Part 1 (7AM):
                                3 cups of Coffee each with 3 Tbsp 1/2 and 1/2 (180 calories)
				1 hard boiled Jumbo egg with salt and pepper (90 calories)

		Breakfast Part 2 (10AM):
				1 grapefruit cup (60 calories)
				1 ounce mixed nuts (170 calories)
				
                Lunch Part 1 (12PM):
                                4 oz of sauteed chicken breast with seasoning (187 calories)
                                2 cups of raw spinach (28 calories)

                                1/2 a peanut butter cookie (? calories)

		Notes:
				I ended up eating two peanut butter cookies instead of just 1/2 one. I skipped the treadmill
				and did my arm workout at 44 reps (I also did it yesterday but didn't note it).
				I did a check of my weight and I was still down half a pound from the beginning of this week
				even with these deviations from the plan. For the 29th and onward will try eating
				a whole cookie at the end of each day and see if I lose weight for the whole week.

<b>Day 4 (11/30/2023)</b>

		 Breakfast Part 1 (7AM):
                                3 cups of Coffee each with 3 Tbsp 1/2 and 1/2 (180 calories)
				1 hard boiled Jumbo egg with salt and pepper (90 calories)

		Breakfast Part 2 (10AM):
				1 grapefruit cup (60 calories)
				1 ounce mixed nuts (170 calories)
				
                Lunch Part 1 (12PM):
                                4 oz of sauteed chicken breast with seasoning (187 calories)
                                2 cups of raw spinach (28 calories)
				1 parsnip (75 calories)
				
		Lunch Part 2 (3PM):
				2 oz of baked salmon (118 calories)
				50 grams of brown rice (170 calories)
				
                Dinner (5PM):
				100 grams broccoli and 100 grams cauliflower tossed in 1 Tbsp olive oil and baked (197 calories)
                                1 peanut butter cookie (? calories)

		Notes:
				Did my arm workout with 46 reps but skipped treadmill. Ended up overeating. Again. Need to find
				a dessert that's satisfying yet doesn't trigger binges like I think the peanut butter cookie does.
				Another problem is I keep eating all the rest of my allotted food at 3PM. Then I get hungry again
				and overeat. I don't think it's realistic to end the day simply with vegetables, plus
				when I cook the salmon I cook the vegetables because I don't want to have to use the oven twice.
				I'm not sure how to solve this since immediately after work I get the munchies. Maybe I'll try
				just having the rice at 3PM and then having the fish and vegetables at 5PM.
