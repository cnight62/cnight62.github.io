		<h2>Week 3 - starting weight: 205.8lb</h2>
		
			<pre>
<b>Day 1 (6/15/2024)</b>

                Breakfast (7AM):
				3 cups of Coffee with half and half (~300 calories)
				1/2 cup oatmeal with 15 blueberries and 2 Tbsp maple syrup (245 calories)
				
                Lunch (12PM):
                                2 oz of chicken, 2 oz of sweet potato on a 60 cal wrap with ranch (~300 calories)
				
		Dinner (4PM):
				1 3oz crabcake (200 calories)
				300g green beans (100 calories)

		Exercise:
				None.

		Notes:
				I followed my plan perfectly. Day 1 of "abstinence" as OA calls it. I am considering foregoing
				restaurants and delivery even when I visit my sister in July, just staying at her house while
				they go out and sticking with my 300 calorie meals. It depends. Technically I am allowed
				to go to a restaurant as long as I KNOW what I'm eating is 300 cal or less. I really want to
				get 30 days of abstinence in so I can move on to the next behavior modification, which is
				to add exercise to my life.
